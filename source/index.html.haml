      %h3 Bible First
      %p
        Bible First is an evangelistic correspondence course designed to reach
        unbelievers by involving them in a chronological study of the book of
        Genesis. Over the course of 20 lessons, students are presented not only
        with the Gospel, but every major doctrine in Scripture. The lessons
        point to Jesus, drawing on the types and parallels that God Himself
        built into Genesis.
      %p
        Our team began developing the Bible First program in 2004, and our
        first students enrolled in 2006. Today, Bible First in Ukraine reaches
        several hundred students living in every one of the country's 24
        oblasts. Bible First materials are currently available in both English
        and Ukrainian, and you can use them in your own ministry to point
        others to Christ.

      %h3 Carpathian Mountain Outreach
      %p
        Carpathian Mountain Outreach (CMO) is a short-term missions project
        hosted every summer by ETO. The goal of this project is two-fold:
        to preach the Gospel in Ukraine and to train young men in foreign
        missions.
      %p
        Each CMO project lasts about two months, during which time our team
        makes weekly trips into the Carpathians, showing Christian films and
        preaching Christ in the villages. While in the mountains, team members
        live on a fairly primitive level. We cook meals on camp stoves, sleep
        in tents, and often walk many miles a day. On weekdays, we conduct
        large-scale literature outreaches in Lâ€™viv and other urban centers.
