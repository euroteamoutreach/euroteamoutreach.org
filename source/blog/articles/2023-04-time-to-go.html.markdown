Perhaps you saw our preliminary announcement last month about CMO 2023. Perhaps you wondered if the project would really get off the ground. (We did!) Or perhaps you took a step of faith and filled out our CMO Pre-registration form. Regardless, today we have another exciting announcement. For the first time in nearly four years, registration for Carpathian Mountain Outreach is open! 🥳

### ⛰️ CMO 2023 Project Overview

Here's a quick look at the top need-to-know data points of CMO 2023.

#### 📆 What are the dates?

CMO 2023 is scheduled to begin on **August 8, 2023** and end on **August 30, 2023**.

#### ⚡️ What is the registration deadline?

If you want to participate in CMO 2023, we need to have your application in hand no later than **June 1, 2023**.

#### 💵 How much does it cost?

**$700** personal support (recommended) and **$700** for the Operations Fee. Total cost (not including airfare) is **$1,400**.

#### 🙋🏻‍♂️ What is the age limit?

The minimum age for CMO applicants is 17 years old.

#### 🪖 What about the war?

The war is ongoing. However, the majority of the fighting is occurring in the far east and south of the country. CMO takes place in *western Ukraine*. There is certainly risk associated with travel to Ukraine, but we believe that coming for CMO is reasonably safe. Ultimately, the decision to come or not will be up to you and will depend on your level of risk tolerance.

#### 📑 The Info Pack, Application, etc.

This year, we’ve taken our application process completely online. No more filling out paper forms to send off in the mail. We still have several PDF downloads (like the venerable [Info Pack](https://cmoproject.org/files/cmo-2023-info-pack.pdf){: target="blank"}), but most of these are for reference only. Once you’re ready to begin the application process, you’ll be guided through a multi-part online form. Much faster!

### 🚀 Next Steps

Time is short, so if you’re interested in CMO 2023, don’t wait! The [CMO website](https://cmoproject.org/){: target="blank"} has been fully updated for the 2023 project, so head over there today and get started on your application!

### 🌍 Conclusion

The world is crazy right now. We’ve been through 3+ years of a global pandemic, Ukraine is locked in a war for its very existence, and western society seems to be sliding ever more swiftly into moral darkness. Dangers abound, and nothing is certain. Yet, if ever there was a time for the children of God to stand up and speak out, surely that time is now.

Despite all the change and uncertainty we face, Christ’s great command to His disciples stands exactly where it always has: pointing us to the endless harvest fields, filled with souls, waiting to hear the Gospel voice of the Savior. *“Go ye therefore, and teach all nations...” (Matthew 28:19)*

Are you ready? *It’s time to go.*
