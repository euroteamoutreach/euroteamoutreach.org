It's late Friday evening, and we've just returned to L'viv after a full day of ministry in the Carpathians. We have two film showings scheduled for this Sunday, July 15th. Today we visited both of those villages — [Opaka](https://uk.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%9E%D0%BF%D0%B0%D0%BA%D0%B0){: target="blank"} and [Zalokots](https://uk.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%97%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%BE%D0%BA%D0%BE%D1%82%D1%8C){: target="blank"} — and distributed fliers inviting people to attend the showings. God blessed and everything went smoothly. We're excited to see what He is going to do on Sunday!

As we begin our 11th CMO project, I'd like to give you a taste of what's to come. Below I've included a few photos from our day which show the guys in action. Each week of CMO, these men will be publishing reports about the work, along with photos and prayer requests. We'd like to invite you to join us for this journey as we bring the Gospel to people in the [Carpathian Mountains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpathian_Mountains){: target="blank"} and across Western Ukraine.

If you've not already done so, please take a moment to [subscribe to our eReport](/subscribe){: target="blank"}. That way, you'll be sure to receive the guys' updates. Lord willing, the first one will be up this coming Tuesday. Meanwhile, please pray with us as we minister over the next couple of days.

### How You Can Pray

* Pray for the two film showings on Sunday, July 15th, in the villages of Zalokots ([2pm EEST](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/ukraine/lviv){: target="blank"}) and Opaka ([5pm EEST](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/ukraine/lviv){: target="blank"}).
* Pray for boldness and wisdom as we undertake our first chalk-art presentation of the year this Saturday, July 14th. Pray that people would stop and listen to the preaching, and that the Lord would protect us from opposition.
* Pray for health and strength as the men get acclimated to a new time zone, new food, a foreign language, and all the other challenges of life abroad.

All the guys got in plenty of walking as we went from house to house, placing film invites on the gates. It's a great opportunity to start practicing those Ukrainian phrases!
