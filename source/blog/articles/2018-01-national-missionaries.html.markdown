Meet Anatoli and Anastasia! Or, as we've known them for many years, Tolik and Nastia. I was first introduced to Tolik and Nastia back in 2001 before they were married. They were teenagers then, both actively involved in their local Greater Grace church here in L'viv â€” the same church we attend today. Over the years I've watched them grow and mature in Christ, marry and start a family, and remain active in ministry.READMORE

In recent blog posts, both Nathan and I have announced that the Zhylavy's are now ministering as full-time missionaries with ETO. We are thrilled to have them on board, and in this post I'd like to introduce their family more fully. I'd also like to point out some of the reasons we are so excited to have them on staff. If you'd like to learn more about how you can pray for and support these Ukrainian national missionaries, read on!

### Proven Gospel Ministers

In 2007, the Zhylavy's were sent out from Greater Grace Church as missionaries to the city of Uzhhorod. There, Tolik took over the pastorate of a young local church and helped it to grow. He and Nastia lived on a shoestring budget, and the church gathered each week in homes.

During their years in Uzhhorod, Tolik and Nastia proved themselves faithful and diligent missionaries. They returned to L'viv in 2011 where they have continued to be active in ministry both within the church and in reaching out to the lost.

### A Trained Linguist

Tolik has a degree in Ukrainian philology from Ivan Franko National University in L'viv. In addition to working as a professional interpreter, Tolik also has great experience producing written translations. He has translated various texts for ETO on several occasions, and in 2015 he performed vital translation work and logistics coordination for the [Festival of Hope](https://billygraham.org/story/christians-in-ukraine-after-festival-of-hope-great-and-mighty-is-our-god/){: target="_blank"} event organized by the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association.

Tolik is currently translating No Greater Joy's [Good and Evil book](https://nogreaterjoy.org/ministry/good-and-evil/){: target="_blank"} into Ukrainian. As he progresses, Nathan and I come behind him, reading every word and discussing possible changes. We are very impressed with the quality of his work, and we're excited about the completion of this project.

### The Ukrainian Touch

Although every Ukraine-based ETO staff member reads, writes, and speaks fluent Ukrainian, we are nonetheless Americans. There are times in ministry when just knowing the right words is not enough. This is one of the reasons why we are so excited to have the Zhylavy's on board! As Ukrainians, they can pick up nuances of language and culture which we believe will provide a strategic advantage as we expand Bible First, CMO, and our other outreaches in Ukraine.

### The Family Example

As the Bible tells us both in 1 Timothy and Titus, God's ministers should also be good family men. Not only are Tolik and Nastia glowing examples of Christ-like living themselves, but they are successfully training their children in the ways of the Lord. Bright eyes, cheerful smiles, and obedient behavior all point to the harmony and joy that is deeply rooted in the Zhylavy family.

### How you can help

When the Zhylavy's joined ETO last August, Tolik left a well-paid position as a professional translator working with the U.S. Military. Their family is living by faith, trusting God to meet their needs while they minister full-time with ETO. ETO is providing what help it can, but we would love to see their support base expand.

Tolik and Nastia are faithful missionaries, and we believe they have the potential to do great things for God's kingdom. If you would like to contribute to the Zhylavys' family and ministry, please send a check payable to Euro Team Outreach, Inc., to the address below. **Write "National Missionaries" in the memo line on the check.**
