Have you ever lied? Of course you have. We all have. But what class does that put you in? Liar. Have you ever stolen? Maybe you haven&apos;t robbed the bank, but you&apos;ve taken things that don&apos;t belong to you. What does that make you in God&apos;s eyes? Thief.

There are no exceptions. Guided by the law of God written in your heart, you've embraced a very specific moral code as the only good and reasonable way for humans to live. This is evident in the fact that you judge others when they don't measure up. You are holding to truth in your mind but violating it with your actions. You are the very person God refers to in Romans 1:18: *"For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who **hold the truth in unrighteousness**;"*

God is holy, and He does not forget. He says of Himself in the Bible: *&quot;The LORD is longsuffering, and of great mercy, forgiving iniquity and transgression, and **by no means clearing the guilty**...&quot;*
