#### The Church

We believe that the Church is the body of our Lord Jesus Christ, made up of all those who have believed on His Name.

We furthermore believe that the Church operates in the world as multiple, autonomous groups of believers, who assemble for the purpose of fellowship, teaching, worship, and edification. We believe that the Church is called to holiness, and is commissioned to preach the Gospel of Jesus Christ to every creature.
