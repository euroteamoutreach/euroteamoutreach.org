*"And the things that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men, who shall be able to teach others also." (2 Timothy 2:2)*

In addition to ministering the Gospel personally, it is our desire to pass on to others the things God has taught us. During the summer months, ETO hosts Carpathian Mountain Outreach, a short-term missions project for young men. While in Ukraine, these men serve alongside our staff missionaries, taking an active role in sharing Christ, and learning first-hand what it means to be a missionary abroad.
