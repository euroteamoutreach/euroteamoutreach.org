#### Hell

We believe that hell is a literal place of eternal judgment and torment created by God for the devil and his angels. All men and women who have sinned against God, and who refuse to believe the Gospel of Jesus Christ, will be condemned to hell without hope of deliverance.

On judgment day, the dead in hell will be raised, judged for their deeds, and cast into a lake burning with fire and brimstone. The smoke of their torment will rise up forever before the Lamb of God, whose mercy they rejected.
