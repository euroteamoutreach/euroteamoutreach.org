Judgment day is coming, and no one is exempt. The Bible says, *&ldquo;The eyes of the LORD are in every place, beholding the evil and the good.&rdquo; (Proverbs 15:3)*

God has seen and recorded everything you&apos;ve ever done, said, thought, or even intended. On Judgment Day you will stand before Jesus Christ and give an answer for how you have used the body He gave you. On that day, everyone will be tried, and there are only *two* possible outcomes: **guilty** or **innocent**.

What will your verdict be? The Bible says, *&ldquo;But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.&rdquo; (Revelation 21:8)*
