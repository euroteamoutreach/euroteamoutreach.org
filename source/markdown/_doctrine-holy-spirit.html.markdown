#### The Holy Spirit

We believe that the Holy Spirit (Holy Ghost) is God Almighty, the third person of the God-head. He is the Comforter promised by Jesus when He was with His disciples, sent into the world to teach us the ways of God. The Holy Spirit indwells **every** true believer from the moment of salvation.

* Romans 8:9-11, 14-16, 26
* John 14:26
