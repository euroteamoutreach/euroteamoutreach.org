## Jesus has paid for all of your sins.

It is done. There is nothing you can add to it. When Christ died on the cross, He cried out, &quot;It is FINISHED!&quot; And so it is. But will you believe on His name? As long as you attempt to earn God&apos;s favor, He will reckon with you based on your works. You will be found guilty and condemned.

But if you believe on Jesus, He will give you His righteousness. &quot;...we pray you in Christ&apos;s stead, be ye reconciled to God. For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.&quot; (2 Corinthians 5:21)

When Jesus died, He died a criminal&apos;s death. He did not deserve this death, but God placed on Him all our sins. God reckoned Jesus a sinner for our sakes. God says that if you place your trust in Christ, He will impute Christ&apos;s righteousness to your account. Then He will reckon you to be a saint, which you were not, as He reckoned Christ a sinner, which He was not.

And then, you will be met with a different verdict on Judgment Day. On that day, when you stand before God, and the devil points his accusing finger at you, urging God to condemn you to hell, your Advocate, the Lord Jesus Christ will raise His hand, and you will hear that most marvelous of verdicts...

### Forgiven!

Here is a personal message from Jesus Christ to you: (taken from John 11)

&quot;I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die. Believest thou this?&quot;
