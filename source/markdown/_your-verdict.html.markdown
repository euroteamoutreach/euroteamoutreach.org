## What is your verdict?

Judgment day is coming, and no one is exempt. The Bible says, &quot;The eyes of the LORD are in every place, beholding the evil and the good.&quot; God has seen and recorded everything you&apos;ve ever done, said, thought, or even intended. On Judgment Day you will stand before Jesus Christ and give an answer for how you have used the body He gave you. On that day, everyone will be tried, and there are only TWO possible outcomes: GUILTY or INNOCENT.

What will your verdict be? The Bible says, &quot;But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.&quot;

Consider your position. Your ungodliness has separated you from God&apos;s favor, and His wrath is upon you. (Psalm 7:11) Your physical life here on earth, a sign of God&apos;s mercy, is the only thing separating you from everlasting destruction. On Judgment Day all your sins will come out as evidence of your guilt, and you will then be condemned to Hell forever!

Matthew 13:49-50 - &quot;So shall it be at the end of the world: the angels shall come forth, and sever the wicked from among the just, and shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.&quot;
