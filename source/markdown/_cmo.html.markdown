### Carpathian Mountain Outreach

Carpathian Mountain Outreach (CMO) is a short-term missions project hosted every summer by ETO missionaries. The goal of this project is two-fold: to preach the Gospel in Ukraine and to train young men in foreign missions.

Each CMO project lasts about two months, during which time our team makes weekly trips into the Carpathians, showing Christian films and preaching Christ in the villages. While in the mountains, team members live on a fairly primitive level. We cook meals on camp stoves, sleep in tents, and often walk many miles a day. On weekdays, we conduct large-scale literature outreaches in Lâ€™viv and other urban centers.
