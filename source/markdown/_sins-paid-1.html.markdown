It is done. There is nothing you can add to it. When Christ died on the cross, He cried out, &quot;It is FINISHED!&quot; And so it is. But will you believe on His name? As long as you attempt to earn God&apos;s favor, He will reckon with you based on your works. You will be found guilty and condemned. But if you believe on Jesus, He will give you His righteousness.
