#### Baptism

We believe that all those who believe on the Name of Jesus Christ are baptized spiritually into His death. Following this conversion, believers are commanded to be physically baptized (immersed) into water as an outward testimony of their death, burial, and resurrection with Jesus. We believe that while water baptism is commanded in Scripture, is not a requisite to salvation.

* Matthew 28:19
* Acts 8:36-38
* Romans 6:3-7
* 1 Corinthians 12:13
