Nathan and Katelin are serving as missionaries to Ukraine.  Nathan began ministering in L'viv, Ukraine in 2004.  He met Katelin in 2008, they were married one year later, and shortly thereafter returned to L'viv as a couple.

As a member of ETO, Nathan wears many hats. He helps to manage Bible First, ETO's correspondence course. Being a fluent speaker of Ukrainian, Nathan plays an important role in the translation of materials into Ukrainian. As the numbers man, he keeps track of statistics that help ETO refine its methods to become more effective, and he also takes care of the ministry's finances as its treasurer. Nathan is also heavily involved in ETO's summer project, Carpathian Mountain Outreach. Lastly, in recent years he has begun playing a role in the development and maintenance of ETO's websites.

Katelin's days are full as she juggles many things: raising her children, homeschooling, feeding all the hungry mouths, and keeping the cobwebs at bay. She loves people and socializing brings her great joy! She hopes that she can encourage women by offering a listening ear and a good word. A few of her favorite things about L'viv include the open-air markets, beautiful green parks, and how so many places are accessible by foot.
