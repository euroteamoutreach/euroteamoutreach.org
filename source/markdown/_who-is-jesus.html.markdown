## Who is Jesus Christ?

It would seem that we are all without hope. The most pious religious leader would never measure up to the standard God puts forth in His Word. Truly, we have ALL sinned. That is the tragedy. However, God, in His infinite mercy and love for us, has made a way that all men can be delivered from damnation. But there is only ONE way, and that Way is Jesus Christ. Take a moment to read the following points. This is what the Bible says about Jesus:

**He is God.**  
I John 5:20 &quot;And we know that the Son of God is come, and hath given us an understanding, that we may know him that is true, and we are in him that is true, even in his Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God, and eternal life.&quot;

**He is the Creator of the universe.**  
Colossians 1:13-17 &quot;Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son: In whom we have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness of sins: Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature: For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him: And he is before all things, and by him all things consist.&quot;

**He is the Light of the World.**  
John 8:12 &quot;Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.&quot;

**He is the only begotten Son of God.**  
John 3:18 &quot;He that believeth on [Jesus] is not judged: he that believeth not hath been judged already, because he hath not believed on the name of the only begotten Son of God.&quot;

**He is the Savior of all them that believe on His name.**  
Titus 3:4-6 &quot;But after that the kindness and love of God our Saviour toward man appeared, Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost; Which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Saviour;&quot;

**He is the Lamb of God.**  
John 1:29 &quot;The next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him, and saith, Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.&quot;
