Consider what the Bible says about the identity of the greatest Man who ever walked our planet.

#### He is God.
&ldquo;And we know that the Son of God is come, and hath given us an understanding, that we may know him that is true, and we are in him that is true, even in his Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God, and eternal life.&rdquo;  
<cite>&mdash; 1 John 5:20</cite>

#### He is the Creator of the universe.
&ldquo;For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him: And he is before all things, and by him all things consist.&rdquo;  
<cite>&mdash; Colossians 1:16-17</cite>

#### He is the Light of the World.
&ldquo;Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.&rdquo;  
<cite>&mdash; John 8:12</cite>

#### He is the only begotten Son of God.
&ldquo;He that believeth on [Jesus] is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.&rdquo;  
<cite>&mdash; John 3:18</cite>

#### He is the Savior of all that believe on His name.
&ldquo;...we trust in the living God, who is the Saviour of all men, specially of those that believe.&rdquo;  
<cite>&mdash; 1 Timothy 4:10</cite>

&ldquo;But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name:&rdquo;  
<cite>&mdash; John 1:12</cite>

#### He is the Lamb of God.
&ldquo;The next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him, and saith, Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.&rdquo;  
<cite>&mdash; John 1:29</cite>
