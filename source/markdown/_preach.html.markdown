*"Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:" (Matthew 28:19)*

We are actively involved in spreading the Gospel through various means including Christian films, literature distribution, and public speaking. ETO is committed to reaching as many people as possible with the news that Jesus Christ has made the perfect sacrifice for sin, and calls all men to repent and believe on His name.
