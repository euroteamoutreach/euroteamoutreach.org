Consider your position. Your ungodliness has separated you from God&apos;s favor, and His wrath is upon you. *&ldquo;God judgeth the righteous, and God is angry with the wicked every day.&rdquo; (Psalm 7:11)*

Your physical life here on earth, a sign of God&apos;s mercy, is the only thing separating you from everlasting destruction. On Judgment Day all your sins will come out as evidence of your guilt, and you will then be condemned to Hell for eternity.

*&ldquo;So shall it be at the end of the world: the angels shall come forth, and sever the wicked from among the just, and shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.&rdquo; (Matthew 13:49-50)*
