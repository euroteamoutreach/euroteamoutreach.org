You've heard about Him all your life. You know the story of His time here on earth. You know much about Him. But do you know Him? You should. He is your Creator. Read this account about the destiny of those who never knew Christ:


> Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven. Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works? And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity.
