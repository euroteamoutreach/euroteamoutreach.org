#### God

We believe in the One True and Living God, Creator of all that is. We believe that He is Father, Son, and Holy Ghost - three distinct persons and yet one God.

God is the Just Judge of all the universe, *&ldquo;...keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, and that will by no means clear the guilty.&rdquo; (Exodus 34:7)*

* 1 John 5:7
* 1 Timothy 2:5
* Deuteronomy 6:4
* Romans 11:33-36
* Isaiah 45:5-8
