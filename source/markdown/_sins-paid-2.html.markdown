When Jesus died, He died a criminal&rsquo;s death. He did not deserve this death, but God placed on Him all our sins, reckoning Jesus a sinner for our sakes. God says that if you place your trust in Christ, He will impute Christ&rsquo;s righteousness to your account. Then He will reckon you to be a saint, which you were not, as He reckoned Christ a sinner, which He was not.
