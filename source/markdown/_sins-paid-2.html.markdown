When Jesus died, He died a criminal&apos;s death. He did not deserve this death, but God placed on Him all our sins, reckoning Jesus a sinner for our sakes. God says that if you place your trust in Christ, He will impute Christ&apos;s righteousness to your account. Then He will reckon you to be a saint, which *you* were not, as He reckoned Christ a sinner, which *He* was not.

> But to him that **worketh not**, but **believeth** on him that justifieth the ungodly, his **faith is counted for righteousness**.  
<cite>&mdash; Romans 4:5</cite>

Here is a personal message from Jesus Christ to you: (taken from John 11)

> I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die. **Believest thou this?**
