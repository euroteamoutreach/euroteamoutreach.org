*"So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God." (Romans 10:17)*

We believe that the Bible itself is the greatest evangelistic weapon in our arsenal. ETO is therefore committed to involving as many people as possible in studying the Scriptures. We achieve this goal primarily through our correspondence course, Bible First.
