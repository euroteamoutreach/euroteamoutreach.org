### Bible First

Bible First is an evangelistic correspondence course designed to reach unbelievers by involving them in a chronological study of the book of Genesis. Over the course of 20 lessons, students are presented not only with the Gospel, but every major doctrine in Scripture. The lessons point to Jesus, drawing on the types and parallels that God Himself built into Genesis.

Our team began developing the Bible First program in 2004, and our first students enrolled in 2006. Today, Bible First in Ukraine reaches several hundred students living in every one of the country&rsquo;s 24 oblasts. Bible First materials are currently available in both English and Ukrainian, and you can use them in your own ministry to point others to Christ.
