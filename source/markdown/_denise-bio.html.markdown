Denise was reared in a Christian home and at the age of 12 she accepted Jesus Christ as her personal Savior. Early in high school she dedicated her life to the Lord and began looking for what God wanted her to do for Him. While a student at Tennessee Temple University she surrendered to the Lord to serve him on the mission field as He directed. Her home church&apos;s strong emphasis on missions gave her an opportunity to not only support missionaries but also to go on several short-term trips. Besides teaching in a Christian school in Bolivia for a year she has also spent time in Brazil, Canada, Mexico, England and Africa. It was on her second trip to Ukraine that God spoke to her heart and let her know that it was here she was to move and serve.

Denise is sent out from First Bible Baptist Church in Rochester, NY, and since moving to L&apos;viv in September 2003 she has ministered in the local church in the areas of music and children&apos;s ministries. She has also taught English, helped in the kids&apos; Bible club and directed several vacation Bible school programs. Denise continues to study the Ukrainian language and use what she learns to help with the correspondence Bible study course.
