#### Scripture

We believe that the sixty-six books of the King James Holy Bible constitute the perfectly preserved, inspired, and infallible Word of God to English speaking people. As such, we hold it to be the highest authority for our lives.

Furthermore, we believe that **all** Scripture is profitable to us today for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, and for instruction in righteousness.

* 2 Timothy 3:16
* 2 Peter 1:20-21
* Proverbs 30:5
* Hebrews 4:12
